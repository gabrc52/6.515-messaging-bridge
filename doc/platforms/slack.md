# Slack

Slack is a proprietary, workplace-oriented messaging app. The [Events API](https://api.slack.com/apis/events-api) supports [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/socket-mode) which uses WebSockets. (Alternatively, one can also open an HTTP port and have Slack send messages via HTTP requests).

It might require some red tape to get a bot account.

TODO: We can either not do Slack or Stephen could see what the process and API is.
