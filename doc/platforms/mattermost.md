# Mattermost

Mattermost is an open-source, self-hostable chat service that resembles the proprietary Slack. SIPB (computer club) got an instance of it so new members did not have to use Zephyr. Instances are siloed, so someone on the SIPB Mattermost cannot talk to anyone on any other Mattermost instance.

The API is reasonably-documented at <https://developers.mattermost.com/api-documentation/>. You can send messages by making HTTP requests, and receive messages and events via a WebSocket.
